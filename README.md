## What is this?

A space exploration/trading/combat/puzzle game.

### Brief concept

#### 2D universe played through various perspectives
* Ground-level side-scrolling platformer. Takes influence from [Wonder Boy in Monster World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=KEtumiBjpqQ#t=66s). Combat akin to Cobalt.
* Planetary landing scenario. Thrust/Lander/[GravityForce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPC4SIup2RY) style gameplay.
* Cave-flyer with rope&ball mechanic like [Terrafire](https://youtu.be/TKAECEVizz4?list=PLZqxSCLTyztBlkzsgYDadUAVXde5Ti3tn&t=121)
* Space travel/exploration. Travel system similar to [Freelancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=NODc1lXn0ak#t=192s). Combat opportunities. Potential for player-owned space bases.
